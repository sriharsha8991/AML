    "In general, a higher R2 score indicates better model performance. However, when comparing the R2 score between Ridge and Lasso regression, it's important to note that Ridge regression tends to perform better when the number of predictors is high, while Lasso regression tends to perform better when there are only a few predictors that have a strong impact on the target variable"
