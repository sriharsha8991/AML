In this project, we explore image classification using TensorFlow on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The Fashion-MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images of 10 different categories of clothing items, and is commonly used to benchmark image classification algorithms.

> #### Dataset
The Fashion-MNIST dataset is a popular dataset for image classification tasks. It contains 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. The 10 different categories of clothing items are:

* T-shirt/top
* Trouser
* Pullover
* Dress
* Coat
* Sandal
* Shirt
* Sneaker
* Bag
* Ankle boot

> #### Training and Evaluation
The TensorFlow library was used to train a deep neural network on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The neural network consists of several layers of convolutional and pooling operations, followed by several fully connected layers. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. The accuracy of the model was measured using the classification accuracy metric.

> #### Results
The trained model achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the test set. This demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms for image classification tasks on non-handwritten digits.

> #### Conclusion
In this project, we explored image classification using TensorFlow on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The trained model achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms for image classification tasks on non-handwritten digits. The code for this project can be found in the Jupyter notebook provided in this repository.
